Generates and prints lists of Schläfli symbols (e.g. {5/2}; represents a pentagon) for a given range of regular polygons.

The non-degenerates list is composed of all the coprime pairs of sides and density (e.g. {3/1}; represents a triangle). The degenerates list contains the rest (e.g. {6/2}; represents a hexagram or two triangles).
